# Git for Version Control

Welcome to the "Introduction to Programmability" series. In this repository you will find the tasks related to the content we covered in the session.

This content is intended for you to follow along and try out. Technology is learned by doing so each section includes exercises with solutions for you to solve.

> :computer: This is an exercises. They might contain sample code that you need to extend upon like this:

## Why Git?

Git is a distributed version control system. What this means is that Git is really great for sharing code with many individuals while enabling you to keep your changes synchronized, properly versioned, and with a complete replica of the commits and repo content.

### Tasks

* In part one of this training we will start from scratch and get familiar with the basic concepts of git using the cli, to add, commit and validate our repository.
[Go to exercises](git_one_tasks.md)

* In part two of this training we will build on the basics from the last session to explore branches and how to resolve common issues with our workspace and remote repositories. [Go to exercises](git_two_tasks.md)

* In addition to that we will have a look at how to work with remote repositiories and some common functions within GitHub.

### Help

If you get stuck here's a handy cheat sheet from GitHub *[Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)*.
